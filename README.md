# Developer User Story

This repo contains my submission for the OAISD user story. It consists of a simple SPA with a minimal API that uses Typescript for the frontend and ASP.NET for the backend. I also made heavy use of React and Material UI.

There are multiple ways to run this project.
The simplest way is to run [the server exe](./dev-user-story.published/dev-user-story.Server.exe) and go to the localhost address listed at the top of the window.
If you want to run it with robust profiling, I recommend adding the solution to Visual Studio.
And finally, to run it locally follow these steps:

- In [./dev-user-story.Server](./dev-user-story.Server), execute `dotnet run` to kickstart the backend.
- In [./dev-user-story.client](./dev-user-story.client), execute `npm i --include-dev` followed by `npm run dev` to start the frontend.
- Visit the localhost address displayed in your terminal to view the website.

If you have any questions or issues prior to the interview, please feel free to reach out!
